  # (interface references).  If we returned a raw int, we couldn't pipeline
  # on it.  So, we wrap each result in a `Value` capability, and also accept
  # these as inputs.  A future version may add syntax sugar to simplify this.
  # In practice, though, it's far more common to want to pipeline on things
  # that are already capabilities anyway, not primitive values.
